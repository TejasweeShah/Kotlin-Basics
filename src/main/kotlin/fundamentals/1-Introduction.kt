 *  WHAT is Kotlin ?
 *  1. Kotlin is a modern programming language by JetBrains. (A statically programmed language i.e. recognises most of the errors on compile time)
 *  2. It's a cross-platform language & can be used for Android development, web-frontend, server-side or Multiplatform.
 *  3. Kotlin code runs on JVM is eventually converted to byte code.
 *  4. Open Source
 *
 *  WHY Kotlin ?
 *  1. Makes code small, concise, readable & maintainable
 *  2. Null Safe and removes a lot of boilerplate code
 *  3. Object-oriented(classes, objects, encapsulation ets..) & functional(higher order functions, lambdas, first class functions etc.)
